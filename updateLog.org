   Added a new folder for documentation.

   of what's working and what's not.

** Wed Jul 08, 2015 21:06:21 rethinking workflow
   Don't really need to store joins in a table, that might just make
   things needlessly complex. 

   [[file:schemaUpdate.20150708.sql]]

   
drop table if exists user_schedule_notes;

create table user_schedule_notes (
	id int primary key unique auto_increment,
	`user_schedule_id` int,
	`notes_user_id` int,
	foreign key (`user_schedule_id`) references user_schedule.id
		on delete set null on update cascade,
	foreign key (`notes_user_id`) references notes_user.id
		on delete set null on update cascade
)engine=innodb;      



 Instead of making a table like above, the result can be stored in
 PHP instead of SQL.  Not sure what the pros and cons are in the big
 picture, but one pro is that SQL tables don't need to be created.

 The idea is to store a join between user_schedule.ids and
 notes_user.ids.

 Queries:

 select note from note_user where user=1;

 Wed Jul 08, 2015 21:32:09 
 Rethinking this, it's probably a lot easier to use a table....

 The table above still won't build however.

*** Thu Jul 09, 2015 12:28:38 still working on inserting schedules when blogs are inserted

    The basic idea got a little lost in some skirmishes this
    morning.  
    
    What I'm trying to accomplish is inserting an event in SQL
    every time a blog post is inserted.  

    That's only part of the problem really, but it's the most
    immediate thing. 

    So [[file:blog.js::function%20giveBlogInsertionToButler(][insertBlog]] in javascript calls [[file:accountant.php::function%20insertBlog][insertBlog]] in PHP.   The PHP
    function should then call another function that will insert an
    event - ([[file:accountant.php::function%20insertSchedule][insertSchedule]]) in PHP.  

    The middle man function should get the current date/time
    somehow.  

    That's what I was working on earlier.  I needed to test if the
    schedule table in SQL can handle the result of PHP's getdate()
    function. http://php.net/manual/en/function.getdate.php

    [[file:logs/2015-07-09-Get-DateString-From-PHP.org]]


    Here's how to get the string as:  "2015-7-9"


    $thisTime = getdate();
    $thisTimeString = "$thisTime[year]-$thisTime[mon]-$thisTime[mday]";

    Now the test is to see if mysql will accept this string as
    valid.  

    Note that I'm also missing the time of day in this string format..

*** thoughts on the event - note - posting system
    This probably deserves an object in php, and maybe one in
    javascript. 

    That's going to require a pretty major redesign however, which
    I'm not sure if I'm up to.

    Wish I had a way to estimate time costs for something like this,
    that would be very beneficial on multiple fronts.  

    Meanwhile, I want to keep up my coding streak.  So where do I dig

*** status check 1
    Got blogs to insert schedule events properly, but only when
    they're linked to postings?

    No, but they only update the user_schedule table when they're
    linked to postings?  That seems to be true.

    Investigating.  

    [[file:schedules.js]]  (nothing here)

    [[file:blog.js]] ( not sure, the problem is here somewhere )
	The giveBlogInsertionToButler function wasn't refreshing
	things.

	This flow sucks because now inserting notes on postings will
	refresh twice, but 
		1. Maybe the HTTP protocol caching will minimize that
		2. At least it works as opposed to before. 

*** status check 2
 Still missing notes on goals, industries and companies.

 Still missing automatic event insertion on adding postings, goals,
 etc... (The only thing it works on is blogs).

 This is what I'm going to work on now.  

 [[file:schedules.js]]   Actually, this is mostly done through

 [[file:accountant.php]] 

 A question to ask is 'why does this work for blogs, but not
 postings?'  [[file:blog.js]]

 Sat Jul 11, 2015 10:14:20
 added call to insertSchedule from insertPosting() in PHP.  This
 joins postings and schedules in the display, but it doesn't join
 them in SQL.  

 Do I need to do that?  I think I'll probably want to.

 What's the next thing to work on though?   I think I probably want
 to join goals, industries and companies first.  

 Also probably want to add SQL ids to hidden cells in tables to
 accomplish this.  I think I started doing this with [[file:postings.js::function%20embelishTable][file:postings.js::function embelishTable]]


 Sat Jul 11, 2015 12:59:18 the goal is to generalize embelishTable for an arbitrary object so that sql ids will be stored in DOM.

 If it's possible to store objects in DOM without embelishTable, that might be better.  Harder, but better.

 How is embelishTable called?
 
*** status check 3 
    In the process of trying to store SQL ids in the DOM, I noticed
    that there should be a unique key in user_locations so they don't
    duplicate.

    Testing generalization 0.  Trouble is that the main container
    class holds table names by their first element in the array.

    $("#tableName")[0];

    Running this through jQuery gives a DOM element I think.  
    
    I just need need the selector, not the DOM element. 

    Do I even want to go over why I've stored the first element?

    No.  Maybe later thanks.

    You can get the id from the element by just selecting it's id. 

    var tableName = $("#tableName")[0];
    var idString = tableName.id;

	    So where does this go?  [[file:objects.js::function%20dialogObjectWrapper][file:objects.js::function dialogObjectWrapper]]

*** Thu Jul 16, 2015 20:37:46 How can I construct button combo pairs, pass the to the dialog wrapper?


	
http://www.electrictoolbox.com/loop-key-value-pairs-associative-array-javascript/
If we had the following array defined in Javascript:

var items = {
  "foo" : 123456,
  "bar" : 789012,
  "baz" : 345678,
  "bat" : 901234
};

we could loop through the array and display the index and then the value like so:

for(var index in items) {
  document.write( index + " : " + items[index] + "<br />");
}

This would display the following:

foo : 123456
bar : 789012
baz : 345678
bat : 901234



Por exemplo:

    var items = {
  "foo" : function(){console.log("foo bar")},
  "bar" : function(){console.log("bar bar")},
  "baz" : function(){console.log("baz bar")},
  "bat" : function(){console.log("bat bar")},
};


*** Fri Jul 17, 2015 07:24:54 searching for dialogObjectWrapper calls

files=*.js; for f in $files; do ls $f; cat $f | grep -n dialogObjectWrapper; done

   As shown above, dialogObjectWrapper is called without supplied parameters.  

   I have options, which take time to reflect on.    I can build the
   buttons directly into the object  [[file:objects.js::function%20glo][file:objects.js::function glo]] or
   I can build them directly into their filler methods.
   [[file:goals.js::function%20fillGoals][file:goals.js::function fillGoals]]


   The question is:  "which is easier to understand and maintain?"

   
*** Fri Jul 17, 2015 08:08:21 got a crude generalization going.  Want to solidify it for goals.js

*** Mon Jul 20, 2015 17:42:06 and again,
** Tue Jul 21, 2015 10:04:18 got goal notes working.  Need to think about next steps.

Web scraping is a big thing that I'd like to implement.  I'm still a
bit unsure how to do that.  

I think scraping indeed is probably a good way to start.  At least
just to get a feel for how to scrape things with PHP.  


Another idea is to try to display things with d3 and/or raphael.
That's a tricky step.  

I'm currently stuck on how to pan and zoom things.  

Really got a good chunk of things done yesterday, and that's going to
be tough to match today.  But I might be able to do it. 

Ultimately, I want to push more data in here, and it's already
getting quite slow, so a rate limiter might be useful.  

Filtering results is another key area to work on.

Quick Summary:

1. Filtering Results
2. Use SVG instead of tables
3. Scrape things automatically.

Some additional things of top of head:

1. Promises might speed things up
2. google docs integration (for resume, cover letters)
3. plug into oAuth for authentication
4. separate job scraper
5. get resumes working with realtime api [[file:/cf/home/notes/javascript/google/google-javascript.org::*%20Tue%20Jul%2021,%202015%2012:59:16%20looking%20into%20realtime%20api%20%20][file:/cf/home/notes/javascript/google/google-javascript.org::* Tue Jul 21, 2015 12:59:16 looking into realtime api  ]]

The last list of issues I had was [[*%20Wed%20Jul%2015,%202015%2021:42:53%20decompose%20locations.%20%20Look%20how%20other%20people%20have%20done%20this][* Wed Jul 15, 2015 21:42:53 decompose locations.  Look how other people have done this]]

     - canvas is yet a more complex possibility

     - using accordions, clicking on a location could open more divs
       showing number of postings, number of companies, number of
       industries, etc. Clicking the number of postings would show
       the results, etc.

     - similarly, clicking on an industry could show number of
       companies, number of locations, etc.

   - [ ] add web scraping functionality
     - Sun Jul 05, 2015 13:06:39 this might be too slow to be useful
     - Can make it optional in UI

     - http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/
     - http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
     - basically, all I'm looking for is to populate fields for data
       storage, not crawl the web
     - need to sandbox this issue - probably in
       [[file:/cf/home/notes/php/sketches/]] somewhere

   - [ ] schedules need to be decomposed in sql

   - [X] Adding any posting should automatically insert an event into events.

   - [ ] contacts need to be decomposed in sql

   - [ ] need to give clearer deadlines

   - [ ] add options to group, order and filter tables
     - this probably means that displayTable needs to be altered

   - [X] linking notes to postings
     - [[file:accountant.php]]
     - [[file:postings.js]]
     - [[file:blog.js]]

   - [X] localize foreign javascript code
     - I mean store the files locally instead of using a Content Delivery Network

   - [ ] addresses in contacts
     - again dialog boxes would be a good way to go here
     - [[file:objects.js::function%20setupContacts()][file:objects.js::function setupContacts()]]

   - [ ] tables overlapping boundaries in events,contacts,etc  [[file:schedules.js]]
     [[file:index.html]] [[file:index.css]]

     - a good fix for this might be to use a jquery dialog box to
       display more info about the event.
     - preferably the dialog box will automatically add links to the urls

     - *Actually, to fix the overlapping displays, an accordion is a*
       *better approach.*

   - [ ] full calendar events don't link to event table


   - [X] notes have no interface
     - Sun Jul 05, 2015 12:57:29 started this awhile ago, but it needs
       a lot of polish.
     - started with [[file:postings.js::function%20fillPostings][file:postings.js::function fillPostings]].
     - After the displayTable call, I added a new jQuery .click()
       function which is added to each of the first table cells (via
       a css selector).

     - (DONE) Somehow I need to figure out how to get the posting object in
       javascript based on this info

     - (DONE) break this popup code out into a couple more functions:
       embelishTable, getPostingFromArray.  There could be duplicate
       titles, so this (titles) isn't the best thing to work with

    file:logs/gregsList-2015-07-23.org]]  This one didn't really go anywhere, I got distracted. (but updated)

Fri Jul 24, 2015 09:04:59 
	So I'm just picking up where I left off.   I got it to dump
	html into the console as expected.  

	What I want though, is an array of job titles, an array of
	locations and an array of links all mapped together into a
	nice hash table.

	There might be some other useful data also, but this is
	really the meat and potatoes.

[[file:logs/gregsList-2015-07-23.org::*%20Fri%20Jul%2024,%202015%2009:29:59%20Doesn't%20work.%20%20Reasoning][file:logs/gregsList-2015-07-23.org::* Fri Jul 24, 2015 09:29:59 Doesn't work.  Reasoning]]

	I think it doesn't work because there is no string "<body>"
	in the html.  It's more like "<body data-tn-originlogtype=\"jobsearch\"
	data-tn-originlogid=\"19r0dng0hbqh7esa\" ... you get the picture right?

	So I've gotta work around that.

	I could the string between "<body" and ">".  That might give some
	useful info.  But it seems tedious.  There might be a better way,
	so I'm going to think about it for a min.

	All of the job postings are in the second "<table>".

	Unfortunately, it's not just a "<table>". It's 

	"<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\">"
	"</table>"

	(I think).  

	So can I pull that big chunk?  Maybe I can try.  
	The problem is that it's not in the first table, but the
	second.
	
	http://www.tizag.com/phpT/php-string-explode.php

	Looking back at scrape_between(), it's just getting
	substrings.  Unfortunately, I never got good at these in PHP,
	but now's just as good a time as any.

	So that's a little bit intimidating for some reason.  I
	really just want to hack something out, but it might be
	beneficial to sand box this issue.  I've actually got a few
	sandbox situations to work directly with. 

	On the other hand, PHP is an interpreted language, so it
	ought to be relatively easy to just try hacking this out. 

	Fri Jul 24, 2015 10:30:47 A few more thoughts:
	What's the big difference between the 'i' functions and those
	without?  Is this the case in C also?

	Fri Jul 24, 2015 10:34:34
	From http://php.net/manual/en/function.stristr.php, the 'i'
	indicates that it's case insensitive.  
	
	Might it be easier to work with the higher priority targets
	first? I don't know.

	Fri Jul 24, 2015 14:43:51
	Here's a working result
	[[file:logs/gregsList-2015-07-23.org::*%20Fri%20Jul%2024,%202015%2014:43:34%20working%20result][file:logs/gregsList-2015-07-23.org::* Fri Jul 24, 2015 14:43:34 working result]]

** Thu Jul 23, 2015 09:07:29 considering adding job boards into sql
   This is kind of a big deal because it's going to require a few more tables.

   [[file:schemaUpdate.20150721.sql]]

   Thu Jul 23, 2015 17:26:30
   Probably want to push this to back burner.

** Sat Jul 25, 2015 21:38:27 scraper is getting closer.

	Works on gs2, but not n900t or egil.
	
	Tomorrow, I can get a good comparison of shell logs.

	egil fails on getting the second table for some reason.

	
** Sun Jul 26, 2015 10:15:47 trying to figure out cross-platform inconsistencies in php-curl 
*** test1 scrapePostings function
**** notes


     For some reason, the function works in cli on n900t - armhf, compiled
     from source, but it doesn't work on egil or gs2 - ubuntu 14.04.  

     Prior tests showed stranger results.

     The function worked on gs2 from ajax, but not n900t or egil.  

     I've updated the code since then, so I'll have to test again.

warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

In Git 2.0, Git will default to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

***** Sun Jul 26, 2015 11:04:41 conclusions
****** 11:06:19 Things got really strange here.

      Unlike previously, the arrays are fetched properly from ajax on
      egil and gs2, but they don't work on n900t.  

      Conversely, the arrays are fetched properly from cli on n900t,
      but not on egil or gs2.  

      WTF?

****** 11:12:18 permissions
      I'm thinking this is probably due to a UNIX permissions thing.
      It doesn't explain at all why things would work on AJAX and not
      CLI however. 

      So I could try working through the remaining 2 tests I'd
      established earlier, (anchors and explosions) for the CLI.  

      But there's really no point in doing that other than as a
      mental exercise.  Except that I developed most of this code
      directly on x86 - where it worked at the time but now doesn't! 
      
      Things work in AJAX everywhere they're supposed to with the
      exception of n900t, but that's where I'd really like it to work
      best due to the excellent battery life on armhf as opposed to
      x86.   

****** 11:18:37 Who is the apache user?
      The obvious thing to try is the permissions on n900t.  

      Since I built this apache from source, things are different
      from the ubuntu defaults where there's a www-data group and
      user - i.e. apache runs as the www-data user.  Who is the
      apache user when apache is built from source?

	So it looks like the default user is 'daemon' when apache is
	built from source.

	This is different from ubuntu.

****** 11:47:48 Make the handrolled apache match ubuntu's default


****** 11:57:46 curiouser and curiouser

******* sub thought
       	Just tried the ajax again, and it doesn't work on any of the
       	three platforms.  

******* 12:08:31 tried again, and AJAX works intermittently on egil and gs2
******* 12:09:11 corollary
	Note that while I was running the first CLI tests above, I
	was doing so using gs2's php-cli not the native ones one each
	platform. 

	So that's a big step.  Getting it to work natively on each
	platform. 

	
******* 13:09:38 got things working on cli on n900t.

****** Sun Jul 26, 2015 10:47:41 CONCLUSION:  curl works

root@gspu:/var/www/html/gregsList# 
*** test3 anchors (not done)
*** test4 explosion (not done)
** Sun Jul 26, 2015 20:43:30 got scraper mostly working on gs2
 Running out of steam for the day though.

 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/constraint-primary-key.html

 One of the more interesting things about getting it working is that
 I'm able to see just how poorly formatted my schema is. 

 There's lots of duplicates since unique keys don't seem to be
 working.  (see link above).  

 So tomorrow I can try to rebuild the database with scrapings and
 unique keys.   

 I also need to add a trigger to refresh things when calling the
 scraper. 

 I also need to add filters and default lengths, since having 100
 elements in an AJAX array evidently slows my javascript down too
 far. Might want to walk through things to see if I can speed this up
 somehow.  It's supposed to be asynchronous after all. 
** Mon Jul 27, 2015 08:55:13 as planned.  
*** First thing to do is try re-working the schema to add unique keys.

    [[file:schema.sql]]

    I'd also like to merge all of the updates.  (done)

*** Mon Jul 27, 2015 10:18:11 adding unique keys is proving difficult.
    Can't seem to find this info in the manual.

    The goal is to keep the multiple key combinations of user and
    companies unique in the table named user_companies.


    This is what I currently have:

# contains relations between users and companies
create table user_companies(
       id int primary key unique auto_increment,
       `user` int, # references users.id,
       company int, # references companies.id
       motivation int,
       # need to add unique key here somehow.
       unique key name (name),
       foreign key (`user`) references users(id)
       	       on delete set null on update cascade,
       foreign key (`company`) references companies(id)
       	       on delete set null on update cascade
)engine=innodb;

	Need to add a unique key on the two foreign keys.

	A couple weeks ago I tried: 

	alter table  user_companies add unique (user,company);
	ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '1-71' for key 'user'

	Which resulted in ERROR 1062.  Maybe this won't happen when
	the table is created fresh though.


# contains relations between users and companies
create table user_companies(
       id int primary key unique auto_increment,
       `user` int, # references users.id,
       company int, # references companies.id
       motivation int,
       # need to add unique key here somehow.
       foreign key (`user`) references users(id)
       	       on delete set null on update cascade,
       foreign key (`company`) references companies(id)
       	       on delete set null on update cascade
       unique key combo (`user`, `company`),
)engine=innodb;


	Mon Jul 27, 2015 10:23:43
	Nope.

ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'unique key combo (`user`, `company`),
)engine=innodb' at line 11
ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'gregsList.user_companies' doesn't exist

	Mon Jul 27, 2015 10:25:08
	Trying switching the order up.  I'm not confident this will
	work, but we'll see.


# contains relations between users and companies
create table user_companies(
       id int primary key unique auto_increment,
       `user` int, # references users.id,
       company int, # references companies.id
       motivation int,
       # need to add unique key here somehow.
       unique key combo (`user`, `company`),
       foreign key (`user`) references users(id)
       	       on delete set null on update cascade,
       foreign key (`company`) references companies(id)
       	       on delete set null on update cascade
)engine=innodb;

	Mon Jul 27, 2015 10:26:14
	That didn't give any errors, and the table is created.  But
	does it work?  Have to test it with scraper.

	Mon Jul 27, 2015 10:29:28
	That seems to resolve the duplicate company problem.  Have to
	decide how to add console logs if possible.

 
	Mon Jul 27, 2015 10:36:37
	Added a unique combo on user_locations table.  I think (hope)
	that wraps up the unique key problem.
    
** Mon Jul 27, 2015 10:38:12 next steps to be determined.
  So I think I solved the unique key problem.

  Adding filters is probably really important.  I'm not sure how else
  to speed up the load time.  

  As things stand, the page takes several seconds to load when there
  is lots of data, but it's almost instantaneous when there is not a
  lot of data.  
  
  Chrome developer tools attributed a lot of this to scripting, but
  I'm not convinced it's not transport issues. 

  Just tested bigGuy with firefox.  It only took 37 ms to process the
  post request for 76 postings.  

  'bigGuy' is a scraping of indeed postings for 'software developer'
  in 'San Francisco, CA' with a cap of 100 postings.  For some
  reason, I was only able to scrape 76 postings out of the 100. 

  Mon Jul 27, 2015 10:49:29
  So that somewhat settles the matter for me at present, my
  javascript is definitely sub-par and way too slow,  That really
  shouldn't be a big surprise.

  But the question remains; how do I fix this?
